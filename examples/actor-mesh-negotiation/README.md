# Actor-Mesh Negotiation

A buyer, a seller, and a settlement actor — each an untrusted third-party script in its own `Kobako::Sandbox` — reach a price through a host that is the only path between them. The host owns the whole mesh runtime; each actor owns nothing but the behavior it was written to run.

This is the demonstration of composing *mutually distrusting* actors. Because every actor is one sandbox, a crash, a forged move, or a peek at a rival's private data is contained by construction: an actor sees only the message the host delivered and the capabilities the host bound to its own sandbox — never the counterparty's reservation price, memory, or code. It is the multi-actor counterpart to the single-script examples ([codemode](../codemode/README.md), [serverless](../serverless/README.md), [plugin-rs](../plugin-rs/README.md)): those run one untrusted script, while this one wires several into a supervised topology where the host is the broker.

## The shape, and why it has to be this shape

```
                    ┌─ host (the only path between actors) ─────────────┐
                    │  Broker · authorization matrix · Supervisor ·     │

```

Buyer and seller exchange offers only through the broker; neither can address settlement — the host invokes it once, after both agree. The broker enforces this with an authorization matrix, so a reply aimed at a peer it was not permitted to reach is blocked and recorded rather than delivered.

An actor's private reservation price is a `Wallet` the host binds to that one sandbox; the counterparty's sandbox never binds it, so the number cannot leak across the mesh. This is the whole reason the compute runs in a sandbox rather than as a plain Ruby object: the actors come from mutually distrusting sources, and isolation — not intelligence — is what the sandbox provides.

The guest VM is discarded after every turn (a fresh `mrb_state` per `#run`), so an actor cannot hold state in the sandbox. That is not a limitation to work around — it is the mesh's foundation. An actor's identity, private `Memory`, reservation, and randomness all live host-side and outlive the sandbox instance, so the sandbox is disposable compute the host can recreate at any time with no state loss.

## Running

The script uses `bundler/inline`, so it resolves its own dependencies on first run — no `Gemfile` is required in the working directory.

```bash
ruby examples/actor-mesh-negotiation/app.rb                                    # a deal
ruby examples/actor-mesh-negotiation/app.rb --buyer-max 700 --seller-floor 800 # no overlap, no deal
ruby examples/actor-mesh-negotiation/app.rb --with-cheater                     # broker blocks a forged move
ruby examples/actor-mesh-negotiation/app.rb --with-faulty                      # an actor crashes and forfeits
ruby examples/actor-mesh-negotiation/app.rb --with-jitter --replay             # randomized, yet reproducible
```

From a clone of the kobako repository, prefix with `bundle exec` so the local checkout is used. CLI parsing runs before `bundler/inline` resolves the inline Gemfile.

## Configuration

| Flag             | Purpose                                                              | Default |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `--buyer-max N`  | Buyer's private ceiling, injected as its reservation price.         | `1000`  |
| `--seller-floor N` | Seller's private floor, injected as its reservation price.        | `800`   |
| `--rounds N`     | Message budget before the talk breaks off with no deal.             | `20`    |
| `--seed N`       | Seed for the per-actor Dice RNG; the only source of randomness.     | `1`     |
| `--with-cheater` | Swap in a buyer that addresses settlement directly; the broker blocks it. | off |
| `--with-faulty`  | Swap in a buyer that raises on its turn; the supervisor makes it forfeit.  | off |
| `--with-jitter`  | Swap in a buyer whose bids jitter through the seeded Dice.          | off     |
| `--replay`       | Run twice with the same seed and confirm the transcript reproduces exactly. | off |

## What each run shows

| Property                | Try                       | What you see                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Host-brokered mesh      | (default)                 | every offer flows host → actor → host; the two actors never touch directly. |
| Mutual distrust         | `--with-cheater`          | the buyer aims a forged `accept` at settlement; the broker records `DENIED` and no forged deal reaches settlement. |
| Let-it-crash            | `--with-faulty`           | the buyer raises; the supervisor records the fault, the buyer forfeits, and the host keeps running. |
| Deterministic replay    | `--with-jitter --replay`  | the buyer's bids are randomized, yet the re-run reproduces the transcript byte-for-byte. |

Replay is verified by re-executing the negotiation with the same seed and comparing against the recorded transcript, so it re-covers the broker's routing as well as each actor's play. Determinism holds because the sandbox is hermetic (no ambient clock or entropy) and every source of variation — reservations, seed, message order — is host-owned; the seeded `Dice` is the actor's only randomness.

## Writing your own actor

An actor is a file under `actors/` that defines a `Behavior` with a `self.call(msg)` entrypoint. It receives the incoming message as a Hash and returns its reply as a Hash addressed with `to:`:

```ruby
class Behavior
  def self.call(msg)
    floor = Wallet.reservation                 # this actor's private reservation
    bid = msg[:price]
    return { to: :buyer, type: :accept, price: bid } if bid && bid >= floor

    { to: :buyer, type: :counter, price: floor }
  end
end
```

The message types are `:open` (the host's kickoff to the seller), `:counter` (a price on the table), and `:accept` / `:reject` (terminal). An actor may read only the capabilities the host bound to it — `Wallet` (its reservation), `Memory` (private scratch that survives across turns, since the VM does not), and `Dice` (seeded randomness). Anything else raises host-side, and any `to:` the authorization matrix forbids is blocked. Point `--with-jitter`'s slot (or the `buyer_script` switch in `app.rb`) at your file to run it.

This example is the companion to the single-script demos: [codemode](../codemode/README.md) and [plugin-rs](../plugin-rs/README.md) run one untrusted script against host capabilities; here many untrusted actors are composed under a host that brokers and supervises them.
